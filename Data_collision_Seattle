Introduction/Business Problem
I will research and evaluate the dataset “car accident severity” in the city of Seattle in this final capstone project. I will analyze and determine how weather conditions affect the severity of car accidents. It’s very common for people to relate bad weather to more road accidents, so we usually tend to drive more carefully when the weather is not favorable. Does bad weather directly translates to more car accidents? That is exactly what we will try to verify – if the bad weather play a big role in causing more car accidents.
